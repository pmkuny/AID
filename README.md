# AID
Standardization for AI Disclosures as it relates to Code and Media Content

## Overview and Intention

One of the concepts encapsulated here is the "no threshold" appraoch, which simply means that for the purposes of this disclosure, ANY usage of AI, including AI tooling or a vendor that provides AI tooling (or an output that is AI-generated or influenced) **passes the threshold for AI usage**. While different levels of engagement with AI are later specified, it's important to keep the bar for what actually constitutes AI usage low, in my opinion. This makes it easy to immediately differentiate those projects that incorporate a zero-tolerance rule for AI usage.

A note on vendors: With the rise of AI tooling in businesses, organizations, and third-parties, we hope to incorporate this disclosure as one that is at the lowest level, or as far-right in the chain as possible. That is, the same metrics that are used here on a per-project basis are applied to anything vendor-related higher in the chain. If this project had a section of content created by an AI tool that a vendor provides, then we believe that that disclosure should "propogate down" to this project. Therefore, keeping the "no threshold" rule in mind, any usage of an AI tool to boostrap or otherwise create initial content for this project, passes that no threshold mark.

## Nomenclature

- **AI System or Tooling**: Includes direct engagement of an AI Tool, Assistant, LLM, or third-party source that provides the former. Includes iteration, "spot checking", "tweaking" or formatting-only type tools. 

- **Content**: The actual content of a repository, interpreted widely. This could be images, source code, documentation, tests, or other core content that provides both primary and auxillary functionality to the program or media in question. This takes a "no threshold" approach, where any engagement with AI in content creation counts as a usage of AI in general. Levels of content generation are then clarified in the type of disclosure used. **Note that this relates to content creation only, not any external process such as brainstorming or ideation.**

- **Documentation**: 

## Example Disclosures

### General Usage - Level of AI Involvement

**FAID** - This content was written entirely by AI tooling or systems, and contains only human-in-the-loop interactions, or verficiation for functionality and security. All content should be considered AI-generated.

**MAID** - This content was written by a human, with moderate useage of AI tooling or systems to generate the content contained within. Clarification on AI-generated content may be present, or will require further clarificaiton

**SAID** - This content was written by a human, with small adjustments by AI tooling or systems to ensure accuracy, best practices, or bug-fixing. 

**ZAID** - This content was created by a human, with zero AI involvement.

### Special Usage - Content-Specific AI Involvement

**DAID** - This content was **primarily** written by a human, wtih AI-generated documentation, including the documentation tools being configured in question by AI. All documentation and documentation systems presented in this repository should be consdiered AI-generated.
